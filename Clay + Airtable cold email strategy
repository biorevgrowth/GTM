<h1>Hyper-detailed outline (exhaustive structure & details)</h1>
A. Tech stack & roles

Data & Automation: Clay (tables, webhooks, lookups, Claygen), Google Sheets (interim dedupe store), Airtable (global dashboards).

Sequencers: Instantly (primary), Smartlead (secondary), Bison (also used; some replies lack linkbacks).

Verification: MillionVerifier + BounceMan (API via Clay).

Scraping / Sourcing: Apify (Apollo Scraper by CodeCrafter) against Apollo URLs; Claygen for LinkedIn/company data extraction; StoreLeads (mentioned as a source signal).

Enrichment: LinkedIn (company + personal), Instagram follower counts (via Claygen where needed), mobile numbers (phone append).

Comms & Handoffs: Slack (internal + client channels), WhatsApp (team outreach notices), Hoop (captures Slack/email to-dos), Salesforce (CRM of record for some clients).

Deliverability Intel: EmailGuard API for ESP mapping; exclude Outlook targets as needed; measure Google→Google, custom→Outlook, etc.

B. Data sourcing at scale

Generate Apollo searches; copy the Apollo result URL(s).

Run Apify > Apollo Scraper by CodeCrafter (no Apollo login required) at ~$1.20 / 1k; plan budget (e.g., $1k/mo tier).

Output feeds directly into Clay tables (preferred) or CSV → Clay.

Maintain a Google Sheets master for cross-campaign dedupe (VLOOKUP by email/domain + timestamp, last touched campaign, last sequencer).

C. Data processing flow (Clay)

De-dupe & suppression

Clay lookup to Instantly existing campaigns (exclude previously targeted recent rows).

VLOOKUP against Google Sheets master to suppress previously processed leads; record first-seen & last-seen.

Verification

Call MillionVerifier then BounceMan via API; record result, reason, raw codes; only pass valid/risky as policy dictates; aim for ~1% overall bounce.

Enrichment

Use Claygen “help me” to pull LinkedIn company & personal fields (headline, description, industry, employee count, tech tags); cost target ~$0.004 per profile.

Optional Instagram follower count via Claygen; store numeric value + last-checked date.

Phone append for mobile when “Interested/Reply” is detected (enable SDR call-through).

ESP mapping

Query EmailGuard API on sender mailbox domains and recipient MX/ESP; store sender_esp, recipient_esp, route (e.g., G→G).

Flag Outlook recipients for exclusion when policy requires.

Routing

Build round-robin columns in Clay for copy variant assignment (agent A/B/C and subject A/B).

Split by industry/region persona (e.g., doctors UK long-form bucket).

D. Copy & agents

Agent library in Octave

Each agent = one prompt + variables: {first_name}, {company}, {value_prop}, {social_proof}, {trigger}, {CTA}.

Baselines: “Internal Discussion”, “Josh Braun style”, “Long-form (regulated/clinical)”.

Personalization tactic

First line = LinkedIn company description summary with one unique detail; fallback to role-relevant observation.

Assembly

In Clay, call agent API to generate body only (most flexible) or full email (when CTAs & greeting fixed).

Insert dynamic intro/CTA/spin-tax at sequencer level when body-only.

Variant testing

Week 1: test body variants (A/B/C) + 1 subject.

Week 2: keep winner body; test subject lines (A/B/C).

Track at row level: agent_id, subject_id, sequence_id, send_time.

E. Sequencing: Instantly (primary), Bison/Smartlead (as needed)

Build separate campaigns per persona/ESP route (e.g., G→G).

Daily cap per mailbox; staggered schedules.

Exclude Outlook recipients where policy set.

Drop unique body per row; ensure copy uniqueness (avoid fingerprinting).

Record message ID & campaign ID in Clay.

F. Reply capture & downstream workflow

Clay webhook subscribes to Instantly & Bison reply events; ingest all replies (incl. foreign languages).

Normalize: thread ID, mailbox, recipient, campaign, timestamp, raw text.

Classify: Interested / Not Interested / Referral / OOO / Bounce (secondary) using rules or LLM.

Enrich Interested with:

Phone append

Social links

Any CRM IDs (if known)

Slack notifications

Post to internal #hot-replies and client’s Slack channel (per-client).

CRM push

For clients that require: push Interested into Salesforce (map all enrichment fields + source campaign).

SDR Play

Immediate call for rows with mobile; book on first call when possible.

G. Deliverability management

Maintain Airtable dashboard for:

ESP route outcomes (open/reply rate by G→G, custom→Outlook, etc.).

Bounce rate by verification pathway.

Template performance by week & persona.

Adjust domain pools, recipient exclusions, send windows weekly based on dashboard.

Treat copy uniqueness as a deliverability lever (reduce repeats; inject spin-tax or agent variety).

H. TAM, cadence & re-engagement

Window: Revisit non-engaged leads ~90 days later with a different offer/copy.

Use Instantly lookup for last-contacted date; suppress <90d.

Maintain Google Sheets “evergreen” ledger until a relational DB exists.

I. Organization & governance

Hoop to capture Slack/email To-Dos per client; not WhatsApp.

WhatsApp used for quick “we’re starting” notices; non-system of record.

Compliance: avoid scraping personal sensitive data; respect platforms’ terms; models may block personal PII extraction.

Document SOPs for all integrations (Apify → Clay, Clay → Instantly/Bison/Smartlead, Clay → Slack/Salesforce).

J. Known gaps / wishes

True relational data store inside Clay (rumored); until then: Google Sheets + Airtable.

Apify → webhook direct write-back: currently not ideal; explored vector DBs; future work item.

3) Comprehensive action plan (step-by-step, with “tiny details”)

Goal: Stand up a scalable, data-driven outbound engine using Clay, Instantly, Apify, Octave agents, MillionVerifier/BounceMan, EmailGuard, Airtable, Slack, Salesforce, Hoop; generate consistent interested replies and meetings, while keeping bounces ≈1% and improving deliverability weekly.

Phase 0 — Prep (Days 1–3)

Owners: Marketing Ops (MOps), RevOps, Data Eng, SDR Lead, Copy Lead

Create project spaces

Slack channels: #outbound-core, #hot-replies, per-client #client-<name>-replies.

Hoop: add each Slack channel + your outbound mailbox to capture to-dos.

Accounts & access

Clay (admin + API keys), Instantly, Smartlead (if needed), Bison (if needed), Apify (fund $1k tier), Airtable base, Salesforce sandbox creds, EmailGuard API key, MillionVerifier, BounceMan, Octave agent workspace, Google Sheets master ledger.

Mailbox pools

Warm mailboxes and set sending windows. Tag each with ESP (sender_esp).

Phase 1 — Data sourcing pipeline (Days 4–7)

Build Apollo searches per ICP and export search URLs.

Apify runs

Actor: Apollo Scraper by CodeCrafter (no Apollo login).

Batch size: 50k per run; cost target: $1.20 / 1k.

Configure output → Clay ingest (CSV or direct).

Clay table design

lead_id, email, domain, first_name, last_name, title, company, company_linkedin_url, person_linkedin_url, region, industry, source_url, first_seen_at.

Add suppressed_reason, suppressed_at, last_contacted_at, last_campaign_id.

Master dedupe

Google Sheets “Evergreen Ledger”: columns email, first_seen_at, last_touched_at, last_sequencer, last_result.

In Clay: VLOOKUP (via Sheets connector) to suppress if last_touched_at < 90d.

Phase 2 — Hygiene & enrichment (Days 8–10)

Verification sequence

Clay step 1: MillionVerifier API → mv_status, mv_reason.

If not valid: Clay step 2: BounceMan API → bm_status, bm_reason.

Keep rows with valid (and optionally risky: catch-all) to hit ~1% bounce rate.

LinkedIn enrichment (cheap)

Claygen “help me” configured to visit company_linkedin_url and person_linkedin_url.

Extract: company description (cleaned), size, industry; person headline.

Cost watch: ~$0.004 per profile; log li_last_scraped_at.

ESP mapping

EmailGuard API for recipient MX/ESP → recipient_esp.

Compose route = sender_esp + → + recipient_esp.

Flag exclude_if_outlook = true per policy.

Optional signals

Instagram follower count (Claygen); ig_followers, ig_checked_at.

StoreLeads fields (if relevant to offer).

Phase 3 — Copy & agents (Days 8–12 in parallel)

Octave agents

Create at least 3 bodies:

A: Internal Discussion (short).

B: Josh Braun-style (pattern-interrupt).

C: Long-form (for regulated/clinical ICPs).

Variables to pass from Clay: {first_name}, {role}, {company}, {company_desc_snippet}, {pain}, {benefit}, {proof} (case study short), {CTA}.

Personalization first line

Clay transform to compress LinkedIn description into 1 sentence with a unique detail: e.g., “Saw {Company} focuses on {niche phrase from LI}, esp. {segment}.”

CTAs

Keep CTAs modular in sequencer (if using body-only approach): e.g., “Open to a 12-min chat Wed/Thu?” and a calendar-less option “Worth a quick reply?”

Round-robin assignment

In Clay, create column copy_variant with A/B/C rotating per row; subject_variant default “S1”.

Phase 4 — Campaign build (Days 12–14)

Instantly setup

Campaigns segmented by persona and route (e.g., Doctors-UK_G→G_LongBody).

Add custom fields for intro line and body.

Daily mailbox caps aligned with warmup; stagger send windows; disable weekend sends if needed.

Exclude Outlook recipients by pre-filter from Clay.

Import rows

From Clay (verified & enriched). Ensure each row has: intro_line, body_text, subject, agent_id, route, campaign_tag.

Tracking fields

Store Instantly campaign_id and per-row message_id back to Clay.

Smartlead/Bison

Mirror campaigns if you need parallel capacity. Ensure reply webhook endpoints in Clay are configured for each platform.

Phase 5 — Reply capture & handoff (go-live week)

Clay webhook

Endpoints listening to Instantly and Bison.

Normalize fields; detect language; classify intent.

Slack pushes

Internal: #hot-replies every Interested/Referral with summary + phone (if appended).

Client: their channel with a slightly redacted payload as agreed.

Phone append for Interested

Trigger phone enrichment upon intent = Interested; add to payload.

Salesforce push (per client)

Create/Upsert Lead/Contact with Source = Outbound: <Sequencer>, attach all fields (ESP route, agent_id, subject_variant, LI snippet).

SDR handling

SLA: call within 15 minutes when phone exists; otherwise reply within 30 minutes.

Book meeting and write back meeting link & date into Clay.

Phase 6 — Measurement, optimization, and deliverability (weekly rhythm)

Airtable dashboards

Tabs: Performance (open/reply/interest/meeting by agent & subject), Deliverability (by route), Bounces (by verifier).

Copy iteration

Week 1: determine winning body (A/B/C).

Week 2: freeze body; test 3 subjects (S1/S2/S3).

Week 3+: micro-tune intros, CTAs, and PS lines; add 1 new agent variant monthly.

Deliverability actions

If a route underperforms (e.g., custom→Outlook), reduce volume or exclude.

Rotate domains, refresh mailboxes, and increase personalization to reduce similarity.

Bounce guardrail

If bounces >1.5% in any batch: halt, re-verify segment, reintroduce with different subset.

Phase 7 — TAM management & re-engagement

Suppression window

Suppress anyone contacted within 90 days (Instantly lookup + Google Sheets ledger).

Re-approach

After 90d, re-enter with new offer + new agent family; do not reuse subject lines.

Evergreen upkeep

Append every send outcome to Sheets + Clay; ensure one truth on last touch & results.

Phase 8 — Ops & governance

Hoop hygiene

Ensure every Slack/client email “To-Do” is captured; assign owner & due date.

WhatsApp protocol

Use for quick “we’re live / need approval” only; do not treat as system of record.

Compliance & ethics

Respect scraping/tool ToS; avoid PII beyond business contact norms; accept that some LLM calls will block personal email extraction—route around by using company sources.

Phase 9 — Documentation & SOPs (ship within 2 weeks)

SOP 1: Apify → Clay ingestion.

SOP 2: Verification chain (MillionVerifier → BounceMan).

SOP 3: Claygen LinkedIn enrichment and cost guardrails.

SOP 4: Octave agent creation, testing, and versioning.

SOP 5: Instantly campaign build & field mapping.

SOP 6: Clay webhooks → Slack/Salesforce.

SOP 7: Weekly review ritual & change log.

KPIs & guardrails (make these visible in Airtable)

Bounce rate: ≤ 1.0% weekly average; hard stop at 1.5% batch.

Open rate: benchmark by route; expect G→G to outperform.

Positive reply (Interested): track by agent (body) and subject.

Meetings booked: per 1,000 sends; SDR SLA compliance.

Cost per 1k net-sendable leads: Apify + verification + enrichment (target <$6/1k excluding sequencing).

“Tiny details” checklist for the lead-gen strategy

Use Clay round-robin to stamp an agent label onto each row before export.

Generate body-only from Octave so you can test CTAs and greetings in Instantly.

First line pulls a unique noun phrase from LinkedIn description (don’t just restate the whole blurb).

Stamp li_desc_hash to avoid re-personalizing the same text if the company description hasn’t changed.

Always capture sender_esp and compute route; segment campaigns accordingly.

Pre-exclude Outlook recipients if the client’s sender pool struggles with Outlook.

When an Interested arrives, immediately run phone append and push to Slack + Salesforce; put the phone number in the first line of the Slack message.

Log model & cost when using Claygen/agents (e.g., “40-mini” for cheap tasks; reserve pricier models for fuzzy tasks).

Record campaign_id and message_id back into Clay so replies can be joined to the exact template/agent/subject.

Maintain a 90-day suppression; use Instantly existing-campaign lookup + Google Sheets ledger to enforce it.

For international targets, store language code from reply classification and spin localized follow-ups as needed.

Keep Apify run IDs and Apollo source URLs for reproducibility and auditing.
